Model-Based Systems Engineering for PM2.5 Monitoring in Urban Observatory (October 2023 | Newcastle, England)

• Analyzed the Air Quality Surveillance System of Systems (SoS) within the Urban Observatory,
focusing on the monitoring and analysis of PM2.5 particulate matter in urban environments.
• Explored the integrated network of sensor networks, data processing units, and decision-support
tools in the SoS, providing a comprehensive view of urban air quality.
• Detailed the SoS's design, operational dynamics, and the interplay of its components,
emphasizing its potential in environmental surveillance.
